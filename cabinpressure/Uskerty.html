        This week, Uskerty!
        <br>
        <br><i>(Distant sound of an airport tannoy bing-bing-bong.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Morning, chaps! Look! I’m an Irish guy!
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Arthur, in three days in Cork, have you seen <i>anyone</i> wearing a green top hat with a shamrock on it?!
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(in a diabolical Irish accent)</i>: Oi have noww, to be shure!
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: What’s <i>that</i>?! Irish pirate?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b> <i>(in his equally diabolical Australian accent)</i>: It’s not up there with my Orstralian, I admit! <i>(In his normal voice)</i> Er, anyway, Mum’s just coming. Er, she says don’t file the flight plan yet.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: I already have.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Okay. Er, ooh, and Douglas, um, storm warning.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Ah. Thank you, Arthur. What gale force?
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Er, what does it go up to again? Is it, is it ten?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Twelve.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: I’d say ... eight.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Oh dear.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: No, I-I-I’ve just picked up the weather. There’s lots of rain, but no storms.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: We’re not talking about the weather.
        <br><i>(Approaching footsteps.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Martin, have you filed the flight plan?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Yes, I’ve ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Why? I specifically told Arthur to tell you not to.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But he’s only just ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(interrupting)</i>: I don’t want to hear your excuses. Go and change it.
        <br><i>(Martin sighs in exasperation.)</i>
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: We’re stopping off in Kilkenny on the way home.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: Kilkenny? Why?
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Let me answer your question with a question: what does it say in big letters on GERTI’s tail?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: MJN.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And what does that stand for?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: My Jet Now.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: <i>Whose</i> Jet Now?
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: <i>Your</i> Jet Now.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: And that’s why we’re going to Kilkenny. Be ready in twenty minutes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b>: But ...
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(walking away)</i>: Twenty minutes!
        <br><i>(Martin sighs again.)</i>
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: That’s an eight, isn’t it?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Definitely. Gusting to ten.
