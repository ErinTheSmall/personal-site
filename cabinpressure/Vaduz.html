        This week, Vaduz!
        <br>
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Carolyn, ten minutes.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Yes, all right, Herc. So, last recap: if the phone rings, answer it and take a message. If an email comes in, reply to it. If ...
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Hang on. I’m taking notes.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: But, er, don’t worry about faxes, guys, because Mum’s put <i>me</i> in charge of the faxes.
        <br><b>MARTIN</b> <i>(quietly)</i>: Are you sure, Carolyn? Because some people do still have fax machines.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b> <i>(quietly)</i>: Yes. Yes, some people do. We <i>don’t</i>, though. <i>(Louder)</i> And, most importantly, I will have my phone on at all times. Call me at once if <i>anything</i> happens at all.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Er, i-if I could just clarify that a little. <i>Do not</i> call her, no matter what happens.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Don’t listen to him. Call me if anything goes wrong, or if we get any bookings.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Those are just <i>two</i> of the circumstances under which you should <i>not</i> call. Other such circumstances include the following: <i>any</i> circumstances.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Ignore him.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Ignore her.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: What a peaceful holiday you two are going to have.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: It is not a holiday; it is a ... trip.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: It’s a <i>holiday</i> – the first holiday I’ve had for years.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I suppose normally you’d just wait for the next honeymoon to roll round.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: What?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Douglas is wittily referring to my four marriages, Arthur, as opposed to his mere three.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Wow! Is that true? You two have got <i>seven</i> ex-wives?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Between us, yes ... I think. There isn’t any overlap, is there, Douglas?
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: I’d have to check my paperwork.
        <br><b>ARTHUR</b>: Seven! That’s enough for a netball team!
        <br><b>HERC</b>: What a chilling thought.
        <br><b>DOUGLAS</b>: Of course, if Carolyn contributes her two husbands as well, we’re well on our way to a football team.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Thank you, Douglas. That will do.
        <br><b>HERC</b>: I-I think I’d put my second wife in goal.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Hercules Shipwright, did you just do a ‘My ex-wife’s so fat’ joke?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: Certainly <i>not</i>! She happens to be a professional goalkeeper.
        <br><b>CAROLYN</b>: Really?
        <br><b>HERC</b>: No. She’s huge.
